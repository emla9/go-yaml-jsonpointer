Package yamled implements helpers for in-place editing of YAML sources.

Moved to https://github.com/vmware-labs/go-yaml-edit

Release v0.1.4 is the last release of this package, which is now implemented in terms of `github.com/vmware-labs/go-yaml-edit`, i.e. clients can safely depend on both import paths and Go module minimal version selection will do the right thing.
